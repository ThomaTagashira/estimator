									<h3>Our Story</h3>
								</div>

									<p>FairBuild was created out of necessity and experience. During the height of the Covid pandemic, 
									I founded my own general contracting company. Like many small business owners, I faced the challenge 
									of creating fair and accurate estimates — balancing the need to avoid overpricing clients while 
									ensuring I wasn’t underpaid.</p>								
									
									<p>In the early days, I made mistakes. I took on projects where I severely underpaid myself, leading 
									to significant profit losses. It was a painful learning curve, but through trial and error, I refined 
									my process. Eventually, I reached a point where I could live comfortably, but it came at the cost of 
									relentless exhaustion.</p>					
									
									<p>One of the hardest lessons I learned was the importance of understanding market pricing and 
									subcontracting. After researching other contractors, I was shocked by the inconsistency in pricing 
									across the industry. Quotes for the same tasks varied wildly, and some contractors even based their 
									prices on who the client was—taking advantage of new homeowners, the elderly, or those living in 
									upscale neighborhoods.</p>

									<p>This discovery frustrated me deeply. I saw firsthand how the lack of transparency and fairness in 
									the industry created challenges not only for contractors but also for clients. While larger enterprises 
									had the advantage of systems and data to calculate accurate estimates, many small contractors relied on 
									gut feelings or arbitrary methods.</p>

									<p>I knew there had to be a better way. That’s when the idea for FairBuild was born — a tool designed to 
									level the playing field, provide transparency, and empower contractors and clients alike. My vision is 
									to ensure that everyone, whether a homeowner, a small business, or a large enterprise, has access to 
									accurate, AI-driven estimates that promote fairness and integrity in the industry.</p>
